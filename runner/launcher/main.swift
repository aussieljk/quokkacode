// QuokkaCode Runner: the executable inside "QuokkaCode Runner.app", which
// the runner's LaunchAgent runs (scripts/install-runner.sh writes the
// plist, launcher/build-launcher.sh builds the app). It starts the command
// it is given, `node <home>/runner/launch.mjs`, as a child, forwards the
// signals launchd sends it, and exits with the child's exit code.
//
// Why an app at all: macOS asks about a protected folder (Desktop,
// Documents, Dropbox, ...) in the name of the *responsible process*, which
// for a launchd job is the job's own program, and every process it starts
// inherits it. When the plist ran node straight, every prompt an agent's
// shell caused said "node", and the grant went to that Node binary, so it
// was lost when Node updated. With this app as the program the prompts say
// "QuokkaCode Runner" and the grant stays with the app, which is rebuilt
// only when these sources change and is always signed the same way
// (build-launcher.sh), so it survives runner releases and Node updates.
//
// The child is spawned, not exec'd, so this process stays the responsible
// one. It stays in the launcher's process group, so launchd's cleanup when
// the job ends (AbandonProcessGroup is off) still reaches node and the
// agent CLIs under it, as it did before.
