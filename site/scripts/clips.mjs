// question, and made-up content for a few demo threads (their asks, a review, a panel). The
// pointer is drawn afterwards (clips/cursor.mjs) from where each clip clicked, with the traffic
// lights over the window's corner (a window in the background draws them as a grey blob); both
// pictures are in clips/overlays. Needs Screen Recording permission for the shell
// (scripts/record-window.swift) and ffmpeg. A clip changes the mock's threads (it sends
// messages, answers a question, archives), so record from a fresh instance: stop and start it
// again before running them all.
