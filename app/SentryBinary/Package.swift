// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// Sentry's static framework on its own, for the Mac app (app/Package.swift)
// and the iPhone app (ios/QuokkaCode.xcodeproj). sentry-cocoa's own package
// declares eight prebuilt frameworks and SwiftPM downloads and unpacks every
// one, 3.2 GB in each checkout's .build; this is the one the apps link
// (about 360 MB, every Apple platform). It's under app/ so that a version
// bump here is an app change the installed app updates for.
//
// To update: the URL and checksum are the "Sentry" binary target in
// https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa/blob/<version>/Package.swift.
